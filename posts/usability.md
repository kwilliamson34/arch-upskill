### Principles

1. Scale: Using relative size to signal importance and rank in a composition.
   - When something is big, it’s more likely to be noticed.
   - A visually pleasing design generally uses no more than 3 different sizes. A general rule of thumb is to include small, medium, and large components in a [mini-information architecture](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mini-ia-structuring-information/) (topic or page).
2. Visual Hierarchy: Guiding the eye on the page so that it attends to different design elements in the order of their importance.
   - Controls the delivery of the experience.
   - Can be implemented through variations in scale, value, color, spacing, placement, and a variety of other signals.
3. Balance: A satisfying arrangement or proportion of design elements. Balance occurs when there is an equally distributed (but not necessarily symmetrical) amount of visual signal on both sides of an imaginary axis.
   - Asymmetry is dynamic and engaging. It creates a sense of energy and movement. Symmetry is quiet and static. Radial balance will always lead the eye to the center of the composition.
   - The golden ratio is frequently used in typesetting to create a visually pleasing relationship between font size, line height, and line width. The result typically led to shortened line lengths, which created balance (via white space) on a webpage and made the text easier to read.
4. Contrast: The juxtaposition of visually dissimilar elements in order to convey the fact that these elements are different (e.g., belong in different categories, have different functions, behave differently).
   - Often applied through color. For example, red is frequently used in UI designs, especially on iOS, to signify deleting, a "different" action deserving more attention.
5. Gestalt Principles: Principles that explain how humans simplify and organize complex images that consist of many elements, by subconsciously arranging the parts into an organized system that creates a whole, rather than interpreting them as a series of disparate elements. In other words, Gestalt principles capture our tendency to perceive the whole as opposed to the individual elements.
   - Examples: similarity, continuation, closure, proximity, common region, figure/ground, symmetry and order.
   - Forms often use the Gestalt proximity principle: field labels are close to their corresponding text boxes, making it easy to understand what information goes in which fields.

### Takeaways

Beautiful things elicit positive emotions. This is important for usability, interest, brand perception, and brand trust. (In fact, the aesthetic–usability effect says that when people find a design visually appealing, they may be more forgiving of minor usability mishaps.)
