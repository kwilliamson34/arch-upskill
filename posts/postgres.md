### Quick aside on relational and non-relational DBs

Relational databases: The most popular ones are MySQL, Oracle database, PostgreSQL, etc.

Non-Relational databases are also called NoSQL databases. Popular ones are CouchDB, Neo4j, Cassandra, HBase, Amazon DynamoDB, etc.

Four categories: key-value stores, graph stores, column stores, and document stores. Join operations are generally not supported.

Non-relational databases might be the right choice for:

- low latency
- massive amounts of data
- non related or unstructured data

TODO: NoSQL is particularly easy to scale. Why?
