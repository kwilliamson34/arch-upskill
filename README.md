# Welcome

Check out my journey to upskilling from an engineering manager to a web app architect. Here are my daily learning tasks to get there. It started with the [NextJS tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router) to create a blog-style web app. It can be easily forked to support other learning paths, but maybe you would also like to start from the app ground up in the framework of your choice!
