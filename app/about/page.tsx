              <h2>Finding Software Development</h2>

              <p>
                Early on, my best subjects in school were English, Math, and
                Art. Was it an unconventional mix for a future software
                engineer? I&apos;m not sure, but it definitely explains my
                obsession with pixel-perfect execution, good copy writing, and
                fibonacci python-turtle.
              </p>
              <p>
                I&aos;m also fortunate to have incredible female role models in
                my family. My mom and aunt built long careers from electrical
                engineering, while my grandmother was an accomplished painter.
                Their success continuously shows me that creativity + technical
                expertise is unstoppable.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started my software engineering journey with an Intro to CS
                class at <a href="https://compsci.sites.tjhsst.edu/">TJHSST</a>.
                I was drawn in by the art of crafting neat, elegant programs and
                bringing small games to life. After briefly toying with
                Journalism and Chemical Engineering, I applied myself to
                Computer Engineering in undergrad at UVA. I loved Computer
                Graphics and I railed against Embedded Systems. I had a few
                memorable internships: setting up private cloud networks in a
                server basement, where I became briefly addicted to 5-Hour
                Energy, and fumbling through the construction of an immersive{" "}

                engineer.

              <p>
                I credit so many peers along the way for feeding my awe and
                appreciation for software development. Most of all, the peers
                that got so excited about applying a new tech to our problem
                that you couldn&apos;t talk them out of it. This is what taught
                me the most. Constant innovation, and infectious enthusiasm, is
                what makes this field so fun!

              <p>
                While Iâ€™ve focused on different parts of the stack across my
                career, I now have a decade of experience with full-stack
                development and technical leadership skills, and a front-end
                lean.
              </p>
              <p>
                My journey began at Sapient, where I worked on large-scale
                applications for public sector clients for 6+ years. I honed my
                skills in front-end and back-end development. I was promoted
                quickly, with increasing leadership responsibilities, due to my
                ability to break down and deliver complex projects efficiently,
                and my readiness to think critically about business problems,
                strategy, and continuous improvement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then I joined Storyblocks as a fullstack engineer, and took on
                larger and larger roles, from Lead Engineer to Engineering
                Manager. I led multiple high-impact projects, from creative
                tools and workflows that expanded the Storyblocks platform (e.g.
                canvas-based video editor, AI feature, Adobe plugin) to
                significant product growth initiatives (e.g. plans overhaul,
                stack modernization, core web vitals, SEO). My ability to
                technically direct my teams after layoffs, and be a trusted
                thought partner to Product and Design, was crucial in driving
                these successes.
              </p>
              <p>
                I pride myself on my strong cross-functional collaboration
                skills, and applying an ownership mindset to all stages of
                development. I thrive in environments where I can apply my
                technical expertise and strategic thinking to make innovation
                possible and practical.

                When I don&apos;t have the right obvious answer, I will commit
                to a course of action to move forward. I know I can learn enough

                Feedback loops should be short enough that the value of learning

                and contribute to a team culture of adjusting, when we learn
                something new. I build incrementally with confidence, rather
