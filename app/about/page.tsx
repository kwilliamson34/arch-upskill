        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
          What gives me purpose in my work? Enablement, efficiency, impact. I
          have 10+ years of experience as an engineer working across the stack,
          and 3+ years providing technical leadership and unlocking high
          performance in delivery teams. I have started teams from scratch,
          built strong cross-functional partnerships, mentored other engineers,
          and delivered large features at high velocity and high quality. I am
          passionate about the user experience. My teammates recognize me for
          inspiring and upholding high standards in solution design, code
          quality, and end-to-end ownership.
